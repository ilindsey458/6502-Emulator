# MOS6502 Emulator in C
---

## This is a WIP

This is my C implementation of the MOS6502 Microprocessor. The code is written to be readable and understandable, however this is a learning project and may not be perfect.

### Main Features
- 100% coverage of legal opcodes
- Decimal mode implemented
- Jump table opcode selection
- read/write bus

### To-Do
- Cycle accuracy
- illegal opcodes
- hardware glitches :)

## Why make a 6502 Emulator?
This is a learning project to become better at C and understanding hardware logic / embedded systems. This a fully functioning 6502 emulator that I plan to use in future projects like NES or Apple 2 emulation.
